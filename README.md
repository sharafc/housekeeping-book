# ReactJS Housekeeping Book

Since I was pretty disappointed with the housekeeping apps we had in use, I thought: HEy you are a webdeveloper, why not build something yourself?! I decided to do give this a try as final part of a ReactJS training.
And here I go. 

# Tech stack

## Frontend

- ReactJS
- TypeScript

## Backend

- GraphQL API on Hasura

## Infrastructure

# Beware
As of building this application, there is still an issue in VS Code which is a missmatch between the chosen TypeScript version and the one delivered with VSCode. Yo you have to sdwitch manually.
